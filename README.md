# CIS 230 PASS Session
This is the repository for the CIS 230 PASS Sessions at Lander University led by Joseph Clark.
The files in here currently have simply been uploaded from the Spring 2022 semester. Exercises and slide decks may change. 
As of this writing you may assume Week 2 is correct. As files are updated you will see details about them in this README.  
Each directory contains:
1. The slide deck which is a review of lecture from the week.  
2. The exercises for the week.
3. Solutions for the exercises (when available).  

Be careful of the package statements in my Java code that will remain from the packages I create for organization in my Netbeans project. I will not be removing them.

## Week 1
This directory contains the slides which are a review of how the Java language works including a supplemental PDF from the other located [here](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%201/Week%201/JavaCharacteristics.pdf). The exercises for this week are located at the end of the [slide deck](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%201/Week%201/Introduction%20To%20Java%20Programming%20Language.pdf). The solutions are straight forward and can easily be covered in the session. The hello world task is simple and canbe found in the textbook or anywhere on the internet. The solution for adding two numbers is <nobr>'cis230pass/Java Week 1/AddTwoNumbers.java'.</nobr>

## Week 2
This is a review of basic Java programs. We will use both slide decks in the Week 2 directory, however, we will not be doing the weather project. Review includes getting input from the keyboard, performing basic computations, and using the Math class.
The problem set is located [here](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%202/Problem%20Sheet%201.docx) as a .docx file. Please ask questions about the instructions if needed. Solutions are in the repository.

<strong> Try to do the exercises without using notes </strong>. This will force you to learn the basic commands which will make your life easier.

## Week 3
This is week is a review of selection statements. These are our first programs where it really requires us to read a problem and create some logic to solve the problem. The slides are [here]( https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%203/Selections.pdf). The [exercises](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%203/Selections%20Problems.pdf) are here. Again, do the exercises without use of reference as best as possible. 

## Week 4
We are already in Week 4! Do not fall behind. This week we are talking about While Loops. Looping is one of the most important skills in programming. Make sure you do plenty of exercises for this section.
The slide deck for while loops is [here](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%204/The%20While%20Loop.pdf) and the problem sheet is [here](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%204/Problem%20Sheet%204%20Loops.pdf).
