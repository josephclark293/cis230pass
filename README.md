# CIS 230 PASS Session
This is the repository for the CIS 230 PASS Sessions at Lander University led by Joseph Clark.
The files in here currently have simply been uploaded from the Spring 2022 semester. Exercises and slide decks may change. 
As of this writing you may assume Week 1 is correct. As files are updated you will see details about them in this README.  
Each directory contains:
1. The slide deck which is a review of lecture from the week.  
2. The exercises for the week.
3. Solutions for the exercises (when available).  

Be careful of the package statements in my Java code that will remain from the packages I create for organization in my Netbeans project. I willnot be removing them.

## Week 1
This directory contains the slides which are a review of how the Java language works including a supplemental PDF from the other located [here](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%201/Week%201/JavaCharacteristics.pdf). The exercises for this week are located at the end of the [slide deck](https://github.com/josephclark293/cis230pass/blob/master/Java%20Week%201/Week%201/Introduction%20To%20Java%20Programming%20Language.pdf). The solutions are straight forward and can easily be covered in the session. The hello world task is simple and canbe found in the textbook or anywhere on the internet. The solution for adding two numbers is <nobr>'cis230pass/Java Week 1/AddTwoNumbers.java'.</nobr>
